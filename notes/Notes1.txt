- plate processes as individual agents
- a plate i (where i is the index from 0 to NUM_PLATES - 1)
  listens to a plate j = (i + 2) % NUM_PLATES, or -- to break
  the western orientation of left-to-right -- to a plate
  j* = (i - 2 + NUM_PLATES) % NUM_PLATES, recording its
  audio output or performing a signal analysis, using the
  result of this recording / analysis to create after a while
  its own input signal, which will be somehow "merged" with
  the previous content.

- luminosity processes that are panned across all panes
- step-wise travelling processes: echos, reverberation
  (e.g. plate 2 echoes plate 0, place 4 echos plate 2...)
- we need an incubation sequence that produces initial
  input. this could spark from a self-analysis when that
  reveals a too low energy level;
- MachineListening UGens: Onsets, Loudness, MFCC,
  SpecFlatness, SpecPcile, SpecCentroid
